WHERE  E = B^2/4A^2 - C/A + (AB' - BA')/2A^2.
IN ADDITION, A PARTICULAR SOLUTION OF THE NEW FORM
IS ENOUGH BECAUSE SOLUTIONS DIFFER BY A SOLVABLE AMOUNT.

ITEM (GOSPER):
THE MYTH THAT ANY GIVEN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS MACHINE INDEPENDENT
IS EASILY EXPLODED BY COMPUTING THE SUM OF POWERS OF TWO.
IF THE RESULT LOOPS WITH PERIOD = 1 WITH SIGN +, YOU ARE ON A SIGN-MAGNITUDE MACHINE.
IF THE RESULT LOOPS WITH PERIOD = 1 WITH SIGN -, YOU ARE ON A TWOS-COMPLEMENT MACHINE.
IF THE RESULT LOOPS WITH PERIOD > 1, INCLUDING THE BEGINNING, YOU ARE ON A ONES-COMPLEMENT MACHINE.
IF THE RESULT LOOPS WITH PERIOD > 1, NOT INCLUDING THE BEGINNING, YOU ARE ON A DECIMAL MACHINE.
IF YOU RUN OUT OF MEMORY, YOU ARE ON A STRING SYSTEM/MACHINE.
BY THIS STRATEGY, CONSIDER THE UNIVERSE, OR, MORE PRECISELY, ALGEBRA:
	LET X = THE SUM OF MANY POWERS OF TWO = ...111111
	NOW ADD X TO ITSELF; X + X = ...111110
	THUS, 2X = X - 1 SO X = -1

	R COVERING ALL INTEGERS OF FORM 10 K + 1, 3, 7 OR 9
	S COVERING ALL INTEGERS
AT SCHROEPPEL'S SUGGESTION, THE PRIMES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED MOD 40,
WHICH USUALLY DETERMINES THEIR NUMBER OF SUB-CYCLES:

ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO PRIMES WHICH ARE 1 OR 9 MOD 40
BUT HAVE 1 OR 4 SUBCYCLES.  25 X^2 + 16 Y^2 SEEMS TO EXPRESS THOSE
WHICH ARE 9 MOD 40; (10 X +/- 1)^2 + 400 Y^2 SEEMS TO EXPRESS

2 THIS THROWING IS REPEATED UNTIL HE NO LONGER HAS ANY TO THROW
3 HIGHEST SCORE (DICE) OR MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HEADS (COINS) WINS
FOR POKER COINS, THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY, WITH N COINS THROWN, IS:

NO TWO X'S MAY APPEAR ADJACENT ALONG A SIDE OR ACROSS THE DIAGONAL AT A CORNER.

KNOWN BEHAVIOR:
	FOR LINES, A PERIOD OF 34 IS ENTERED AFTER LINE IS ABOUT 80 LONG.
	FOR L'S, THERE IS A TENDANCY TOWARD LONGER INITIAL SETTLING FOR LARGER L'S,

THE "NUMBER" FOR A POSITION IS:
	MAKE ALL POSSIBLE MOVES, EVALUATING POSITION AFTER EACH
	"NUMBER" IS MINIMUM NUMBER NOT THUS ENCOUNTERED
	THE NULL GAME = "NUMBER" OF ZERO = 2ND PLAYER WINS
THIS "NUMBER" ANALYSIS IS SIMILAR FOR MANY OTHER TAKE-AWAY GAMES, SUCH AS NIM.
FOR 2 BOARDS (NOT TOUCHING) PLAYED TOGETHER, "NUMBER" IS XOR OF THE 2

THE 2ND PLAYER WINS.

ITEM (BEELER):
THERE IS ONLY ONE DISTINCT SOLUTION TO THE COMMERCIAL "INSTANT INSANITY"
COLORED-FACES CUBES PUZZLE, WHICH IS HOW IT COMES PACKED.

ITEM (BEELER):
A WINDOW-DICE GAME IS AS FOLLOWS:
1 THE PLAYER STARTS WITH EACH OF NINE WINDOWS OPEN, SHOWING THE DIGITS 1 - 9.
2 ROLL TWO DICE.
3 COVER UP ANY DIGITS WHOSE SUM IS THE SUM ON THE DICE.
4 ITERATE  THROWING AND CLOSING WINDOWS UNTIL THE EQUALITY OF SUMS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
5 YOUR SCORE (MINIMUM WINS) IS THE TOTAL OF OPEN WINDOWS (UNCOVERED DIGITS).
AN OPTIMUM STRATEGY HAS BEEN TABULATED.
USUALLY IT IS BEST TO TAKE THE LARGEST DIGITS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT ALWAYS;
IT ALSO DEPENDS CRITICALLY ON THE REMAINING NUMBERS.

ITEM (BEELER):
SIM IS A GAME WHERE TWO PLAYERS ALTERNATELY DRAW LINES CONNECTING SIX DOTS.
THE FIRST PERSON TO FORM A TRIANGLE IN HIS COLOR LOSES.
THE SECOND PLAYER CAN ALWAYS WIN, AND WHETHER HIS FIRST MOVE CONNECTS WITH
THE FIRST PLAYER'S FIRST MOVE DOESN'T MATTER; FROM THERE ON, HOWEVER,
THE STRATEGY BRANCHES TO A RELATIVELY GRUESOME DEGREE.
PROBLEM: 6 DOTS IS MINIMUM TO ENSURE NO STALEMATE WHTH 2 PLAYERS;
HOW MANY DOTS ARE REQUIRED WITH 3 PLAYERS?

ITEM (BEELER):
THE 4 X 4 GAME OF NIM IS A WIN FOR THE SECOND PLAYER, WHO ON
HIS FIRST MOVE CAN REPLY CENTER-SYMMETRICALLY UNLESS THE FIRST
PLAYER'S FIRST MOVE WAS B1 AND B2 (ANALYZED ON RLE PDP-1).

ITEM (BEELER):
TRIANGULAR HI-Q (OR PEG SOLITAIRE) IS 15 PEGS IN A TRIANGLE.
ONE PEG IS REMOVED, AND THEREAFTER PEGS JUMP OTHERS, WHICH ARE REMOVED.
WITH PEGS NUMBERED 1 AT THE TOP, 2 AND 3 IN THE NEXT ROW, ETC.,
REMOVE	CAN END WITH ONLY THE PEG
1	1, 7 = 10, 13
2	2, 6, 11, 14
4	3 = 12, 4, 9, 15
5	13
REMOVING ONLY ONE, NO WAY EXISTS TO GET TO EITHER 1 + 11 + 15 (TIPS)
OR 4 + 6 + 13 (CENTERS OF SIDES).  STARTING WITH PEG 1 REMOVED,
3,016 POSITIONS ARE ATTAINABLE (NOT TURNING BOARD);
THE SUM OF WAYS TO GET TO EACH OF THESE IS 10,306.
AN EXAMPLE IS: REMOVE PEG 1, THEN JUMP AS FOLLOWS:
6, 13, 10, 1, 2, 11, 14/13, 6, 12/13, 15, 7/4, 13, 4; LEAVING PEG 1.

HAS LOST A ROOK, KNIGHT, BISHOP, AND 3 PAWNS FROM ONE SIDE AND THE OPPONENTS ARE SHOVED
CLOSER TOGETHER (1 EMPTY ROW INTERVENING).

PROBLEM: SOLVE THE TIGER PUZZLE, A SLIDING BLOCK PUZZLE MENTIONED IN
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEBRUARY 1964, PAGES 122 - 130.

PROBLEM: FIND SMALLEST SQUARED SQUARE (A SQUARE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF SMALLER,
UNEQUAL SQUARES).  SMALLEST KNOWN HAS 24 SMALL SQUARES

PROBLEM: LIST (THAT IS, COUNT) THE SEMIGROUPS OF 7 ELEMENTS;
ALSO, THE GROUPS OF 256 ELEMENTS.

PROBLEM: COMPUTE AS A FUNCTION OF N THE LARGEST SIZE FOR N SMALL CIRCLES
TO BE PLACED INSIDE ONE OF UNIT SIZE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE SIZE IS THE
SAME FOR N = 6 AND N = 7 (GOSPER); ARE THERE ANY OTHER SUCH
PHENOMENA?

PROBLEM: SOLVE PENTOMINOS ON AN 8 X 8 CHECKERBOARD GAME(S).  RULES:
1 THE CHECKERBOARD IS FOR AID IN ORIENTING ONLY; BLACK AND WHITE ARE THE SAME.
2 THE TWO PLAYERS MAY EACH HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF 12 PENTOMINOS, OR
	THEY MAY "CHOOSE UP" THEIR HALF OF ONE SET.
3 THE LAST PLAYER TO PLACE A PENTOMINO WINS.

PROBLEM: WITH REGARD TO DISSECTION THEOREMS, THE FOLLOWING ARE KNOWN:
A TRIANGLE INTO A SQUARE, 4 PIECES (PROVEN MINIMAL)
A PENTAGON INTO A SQUARE, 6 PIECES (BEST KNOWN)
ETC. ("GEOMETRIC DISSECTIONS" BY HARRY LINDGREEN, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN NOVEMBER 1961).
A PROGRAM CAN PROBABLY CHECK THE KNOWN DISSECTIONS FOR MINIMALITY!

PROBLEM: FIND THE NUMBER OF DOMINO COVERINGS FOR VARIOUS OBJECTS.
FOR EXAMPLE, AN ASYMPTOTIC FORMULA IS KNOWN FOR RECTANGLES;
ALSO, ON A SQUARE BOARD, IF SIDE MOD 4 = 0, COVERINGS APPEARS TO BE A SQUARE;
ON A SQUARE BOARD, IF SIDE MOD 4 = 2, COVERINGS APPEARS TO BE TWICE A SQUARE.
PROBLEM: ANALYZE GIVEAWAY CHESS, WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS:
1 CAPTURES MUST BE MADE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH CAPTURE TO MAKE
2 PAWNS MUST BE PROMOTED TO QUEENS
3 KING IS JUST ANOTHER PIECE
4 PLAYER TO GIVE AWAY ALL PIECES FIRST WINS

PROBLEM: ANALYZE "ESCALATION CHESS", WHERE WHITE GETS 1 MOVE, BLACK 2, WHITE 3, ETC.

THE FIRST PLAYER CAN BE FORCED TO DO IS DRAW.
THUS, WITH HEX, IN WHICH THERE IS NO DRAW, THE FIRST PLAYER CAN ALWAYS WIN.

CONTINUED FRACTIONS
*********************************************

ITEM (SCHROEPPEL):
SIMPLE PROOFS THAT CERTAIN CONTINUED FRACTIONS ARE SQRT 2, SQRT 3, ETC.
PROOF FOR SQRT 2:
	X = [1, 2, 2, 2, ...]
	(X-1)(X+1) = [0, 2, 2, 2, ...] * [2, 2, 2, 2, ...] = 1
	X^2 - 1 = 1
	X = SQRT 2
PROOF FOR SQRT 3:
	Y = [1, 1BAR, 2BAR]
	(Y + 1)(Y - 1) = [2, 1BAR, 2BAR] * [0, 1BAR, 2BAR]
		= 2 * [1, 2BAR, 1BAR] * [0, 1BAR, 2BAR] = 2
	Y^2 - 1 = 2
	Y = SQRT 3
SIMILAR PROOFS EXIST FOR SQRT 5 AND SQRT 6; BUT SQRT 7 IS HAIRY.

ITEM (SCHROEPPEL):
THE CONTINUED FRACTION EXPANSION OF THE POSITIVE MINIMUM OF THE GAMMA FUNCTION
(ABOUT 1.46) IS [1, 2, 6, 63, 135, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 43, ...].

ITEM (SCHROEPPEL):
THE VALUE OF A CONTINUED FRACTION WITH PARTIAL QUOTIENTS INCREASING IN
ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION IS
[A+D, A+2D, A+3D, ...] = (I SUB A/D OF (2/D)/(I SUB 1+(A/D) OF (2/D)
WHERE THE I'S ARE BESSEL FUNCTIONS.
A SPECIAL CASE IS [1, 2, 3, 4, ...] = (I SUB 0 (2))/(I SUB 1 (2)).

AS OPPOSED TO THE USUAL FORMULATION OF A GROUP, WHERE YOU ARE GIVEN
1 THERE EXISTS AN I SUCH THAT A * I = I * A = A, AND

3 FOR EACH A THERE EXISTS AN ABAR SUCH THAT A * ABAR = ABAR * A = 1, AND
4 SOMETIMES YOU ARE GIVEN THAT I AND ABAR ARE UNIQUE
IF INSTEAD YOU ARE GIVEN A * 1 = A AND A * ABAR = 1, THEN

P AND Q ARE POLYNOMIALS IN X; WHEN DOES P(Q(X)) = Q(P(X)) ?
(THAT IS, P COMPOSED WITH Q = Q COMPOSED WITH P.)
KNOWN SOLUTIONS ARE:
1 VARIOUS LINEAR THINGS
2 X TO DIFFERENT POWERS, SOMETIMES MULTIPLIED BY ROOTS OF 1
3 P AND Q ARE EACH ANOTHER POLYNOMIAL R COMPOSED WITH ITSELF DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF TIMES
4 SOLUTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE FLOW OF X^2-2, AS FOLLOWS:
	SUPPOSE X = Y+1/Y
	THEN Y^N+1/Y^N CAN BE WRITTEN AS A POLYNOMIAL IN X
	FOR EXAMPLE, P = THE EXPRESSION FOR SQUARES = X^2-2 (N = 2)
		AND Q = THE EXPRESSION FOR CUBES = X^3-3X (N = 3)
5 REPLACE X BY Y-A, THEN ADD A TO THE ORIGINAL CONSTANTS
	IN BOTH P AND Q.  FOR EXAMPLE, P = X^2 AND Q = X^3
	THEN P = 1+(Y-1)^2 = Y^2-2Y+2 AND Q = 1+(Y-1)^3
	THEN P(Q) = 1+(Y-1)^6 = Q(P)
	SIMILARLY, REPLACING X WITH AY+B WORKS.
6 THERE ARE NO MORE THROUGH DEGREES 3 AND 4 (CHECKED WITH MATHLAB);
	BUT ARE THERE ANY MORE AT ALL?

ITEM (SCHROEPPEL):
PROBLEM: GIVEN F(X) AS A POWER SERIES IN X WITH CONSTANT TERM = 0,
WRITE THE FLOW POWER SERIES.
FLOW SUB ZERO = X
FLOW SUB ONE  = F(X)
FLOW SUB TWO  = F(F(X))
ETC.

ITEM (SCHROEPPEL, GOSPER, HENNEMAN & BANKS):
THE "3N+1 PROBLEM" IS ITERATIVELY REPLACING N BY N/2 IF N IS EVEN
OR BY 3N+1 IF N IS ODD.  KNOWN LOOPS FOR N TO FALL INTO ARE:
1 THE ZERO LOOP
